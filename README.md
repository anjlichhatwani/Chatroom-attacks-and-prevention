##Project Setup:
You can use one real machine and two virtual machines to see the effect.
   a.  chatbox-2-21-2016 and Securechatbox run on Server machine  and server should allow users to access it through URL
   b. Fakebook runs on attacker's machine
          i. The attacker will be using Chatroom application like normal users and through phishing he will redirect the victim to fakebook  instead of the original facebook
   c. The victim will run the chatbox-2-21-2016 application through URL
